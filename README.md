# EBS-Work
This is just an archive of programming projects that I underwent for a specific organization.

To be added:
spreadsheet conversion using awk

Added:
-Class Page Scrapper:

This program helps users download all pdfs, word, pages, and etc documents from a course page where they are all hosted. This page lacks a download all button or really any batch downloading ability so I wrote one.

Requirements:

Selenium for python3.4 and bs4 for python3.4

Usage:
./classpagescrape.py username password courseurl

To do:

Mainly just make it more robust and scrape areas other than the topics section (althought this is where the vast majority of docs are hosted)
